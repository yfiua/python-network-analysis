# python-network-analysis
Tutorial for basic network analysis with Python.

## Environment
We use [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) for its stability and ease of managing dependencies. 
For this tutorial [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/) suffices.

To create the conda environment, use `environment.yml` in the repository.
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

This will create a conda environment named `pynet` with necessary packages.
